 Easy Prefab Manager v.1.0
===========================

- SETUP

1) Just install the Unity Package
2) Optional: move the EasyPrefabBrowser folder in another location if you prefer.

- HOW TO USE IT

1) Go to the 'Window' menu of the Unity interface.
2) Go to 'TigerForge' sub-menu.
3) Click the 'Easy Prefabs Browser' voice inside the 'TigerForge' menu.
4) The 'Easy Prefabs Browser' window will be opened.
5) Optional: place the 'Easy Prefabs Browser' tab in the Unity interface, where you prefer (for example, next to the 'Inspector' tab).

- HOW TO SHOW A PREFABS LIST

1) In your Project, select a folder where you know there are some prefabs.
2) In the 'Easy Prefabs Browser', click [LOAD PREFABS] buttons. The list of all the Prefabs inside the selected folder will be created shortly.
3) Click [<<] and [>>] buttons to browse the list (if the number of Prefabs exceeds the maximum number of viewable items, a pagination system is automatically activated). 

- EASY PREFAB BROWSER SETTINGS

The list will be shown accordingly the default Settings parameters. Click the 'Settings' tab of the 'Easy Prefabs Browser' window to change those parameters to meet your needs.
Note that some parameters need the list to be refreshed. If you don't see changes after settings modification, click the [LOAD PREFABS] button again to refresh the list.

- TIPS

Use 'Search filter' text field to filter the list by file name starting, ending or containing a certain string:
> string* search for names starting with 'string';
> *string search for names ending with 'string';
> *string* search for names containing 'string'.

If a Project folder contains 3D Models you want to list, go to 'Settings' tab and check 'Load models' option (uncheck it when you need to come back showing Prefabs).
